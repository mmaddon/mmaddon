        In the notions of interpreting user needs, one must be able to take excellent notes that are through and precise from the user's wishes.  If the user needs different things incorporated into the program, then the development team must be ready to take action in upscaling what is necessary to be changed within the program.  Whether it be different pictures, different colors, different context, or any other attribute the user desires, the development team must be ready to incorportate the changes.  Then the development team can then create a "user story" to come across an end goal for the particular software coming from the user's viewpoint (Atlassian, 2021).
        Lots of times, programs have already been completed through other developments and are needing only adjustments to finish. By utilzing what requirements are necessary from the user's desires, the development team can develop the programs fully and be open to any constructive criticism so that other easy changes can be made and have a finished product.  The Story Point is the best agile process I think could be taken advantage of in Agile project management and different forms of software development.  Their point and purpose are to guestimate the complexity of applying a particular User Story for any software.  They are a good way of  calculating the aspects of how much work there is or is going to be.  It is also important to know if there is any danger involved, both mentally and physically. The comparison allows the team to understand the major difficulty of a particular feature and lets them assign a numerical value that comprehends its complexity (V. & K., 2021).
        
        Finally the idea of being a good team member, personally, depends on how active the team member is on helping to finish the project.  In whatever role assigned, whether it be Scrum Master, Product Leader, or just a regular development team member, participation is key in performance and production.  Also listening and giving other people a chance to share ideas and perform in their roles will help the team in developing a more personal relationship and less of a non-personal, superficial one, which could inhibit any progress and stability.
